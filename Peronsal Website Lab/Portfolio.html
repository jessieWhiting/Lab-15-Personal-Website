        <p.a> This is a link to my very first group project in this field.
            I started the project off by creating the classes and compiling a list for my teammates to use.
            I also worked on the CheckOut(); Method and the PrintBooks(); Method. I am proud of myself and my amazing teammates!</p.a>
